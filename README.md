# FinEx-project
FinEx: Financial Document Analysis Tool

# Overview
FinEx is a powerful tool designed to analyze financial documents in PDF format. It extracts tables from PDFs, converts them into structured data, and performs analysis using the Mistral 7B Instruct v2.0 model. The application is built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface, making it easy to upload PDFs, extract tables, summarize content, and visualize results.

# Features
Table Extraction: Extracts tables from PDF documents using the unstructured library with high-resolution strategies.
Data Structuring: Converts extracted tables into structured Pandas DataFrames.
Summarization: Generates concise summaries of table data using the Mistral 7B Instruct v2.0 model.
Visualization: Provides visual insights with pie charts to summarize table extraction success rates.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for seamless PDF uploads and interactive results display.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Poppler-utils
Tesseract-OCR

Install the system dependencies:
On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr

# On macOS
brew install poppler tesseract

# Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FinEx.git
cd FinEx


Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


# Install Dependencies:Ensure you have the packages.txt and requirements.txt files in the project root. Then, install the Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download NLTK Data:The application requires NLTK data for text processing. Run the following command:
python -m nltk.downloader all


Set Up API Key:The application uses the Mistral API for summarization. Create a .env file in the project root and add your Mistral API key:
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Usage
Run the Application:Start the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

# Upload a PDF:
Open the app in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).
Use the sidebar to upload a PDF file containing financial data.


# View Results:

The app will extract tables, display them as DataFrames, and provide summaries generated by the Mistral model.
A pie chart will visualize the success rate of table extraction.
Allows user to download the table, I will get downloaded in csv format, so it is enanling to visualize from excel, powerbi and many tools.
Also provided a search bar so it is enabling user to search for the specific metic.

# Dependencies

Streamlit: For the web interface.
Pandas: For data manipulation and DataFrame creation.
Unstructured: For table extraction from PDFs.
MistralAI: For table summarization using Mistral 7B Instruct v2.0.
Matplotlib: For visualizing extraction success rates.
NLTK: For text processing.
Other Libraries: For PDF processing, image handling, and machine learning.

# Notes
Ensure your PDF files contain tables for successful extraction.
Temporary PDF files are stored during processing and deleted afterward. If issues arise, check for file permission errors.
The Mistral API key is required for summarization. Obtain it from Mistral AI.
